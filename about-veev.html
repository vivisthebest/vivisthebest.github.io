		<p>Hello, world! My name is Viviana. I am a coder and computer scientist who is currently studying Computer Science at Boston University.</p>
		<p>I first started programming my Sophomore year of High School by playing with Tumblr themes. My <a href = "http://pabodino.tumblr.com">tumblr</a> currently displays a theme in which I altered and customized. </p>
		<p>I officially began my journey to becoming a programmer in college when I took my first computer science course. In just a year, I have taken 7 CS courses and learned 2 languages independently. I have gone to conferences and weekly hack nights. I have founded Open Web, a web development organization at my University, with a group of students.</p>
		<p>I have experience with Java, Python, SQL and many other languages. My resume can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V_imRDBOBvIM6hc6bfcNTSfpMRwDpsuGUEVkOYNObN8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please <a href="./contact-veev.html">contact</a> me for any projects or inquiries.</p>
